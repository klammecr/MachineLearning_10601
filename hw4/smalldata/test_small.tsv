0	i got the nuro virus from this place not having a sanitary enough salad bar and was throwing up so much the next day that i needed to get an iv injected into me at the student health center i have had much better experiences in there in the past and the food is undoubtedly very tasty however after almost having to get an ambulance because i was so drained from food poisoning the nuro virus the serve yourself salad bar atmosphere suddenly lost the all you cant eat appeal and was replaced with a visage of a slightly upscale version of an all you can eat las vegas strip club with less of the grotesque entertainment but all of the bacteria who needs a walk up style menu any ways last time i had that was at a continental breakfast at a marriott hotel i should have kept it that way
0	we came for the live music which was great i love that they have bands there on the weekends but the food and drinks weren t great i had a margarita which was way too sweet i sent it back and they remade it the same they are pre mixed so there s no room for change the thing is in madison there s an incredible craft cocktail scene so the competition is stiff and many of us don t want an overly sweet pre mixed drink but a legit tangy margarita the chips and salsa were also mediocre compared to places like eldorado grill tex tubbs laredo s i d try it one more time for dinner in a pinch perhaps after they ve had a little more time to grow
1	i arrived at oliver s quite skeptical a review of their website had turned up a 14 dollar children s pre fixe which struck me as crazy and fussy but we left the kids at home and had a lovely meal i think now that might be a ploy to keep the numbers of kids low which is fine the cocktail menu is a delight to read with inventive twists on standards the beer selection is very solid all our dishes were delightful my porkchop entrée was absolutely delicious a dining companion was pleased with the trout another dinner found the salmon special to be a little overly acidic i want to make special mention of how wonderful the service was our waiter was familiar and confident with the food and drink menus he looped by the vicinity of the table to see if we needed anything but never once interrupted the flow of our conversation that is so incredibly rare these days oliver you won me over we ll be back
1	i ve been anticipating the opening of the new noodle place umani since i read about its conception having studied the history of ancient japanese art culture in college has made me a bit of a japanophile due to the subtle approach they take in all things beautiful and umami pulls this off my daughter and i went there for lunch and sat next to the blooming orchid in the alcove near the entrance good for a escape route with an almost 3 year old we were greeted right away and made to feel welcome we choose one of three lunch combination options the miso udon with roast pork soup other choices include chicken and shitake and the chicken and shitake dumplings for ten bucks other choices are pork chicken and chives veggie they were nice enough to bring us edamame that wasn t on the menu the soup was out of sight although i wish it were hot i know that is sacrilege to a miso which survives to be the most nourishing at a certain temperature the noodles were perfect the pork melted in my mouth i had to ask about the infused egg which was quite honestly a turn on an almost hard boiled chicken egg with a creamy center but not runny it had a dark liquid running through it which the waiter couldn t explain to me which brings me to the service of corse umami is still working out the kinks of what a new restaurant brings and i understand that so i can overlook the waiter not knowing how to describe something especially when it s so damn good but what s hard to comprehend is the counter service in a day and age where people don t have money to tip but still want to dine out a lot of counter service joints have sprung up but umami lends itself to table service i don t want my dumplings or soup to get cold while i go up to order another sake and even more important i might not order another sake because i have to get up and leave my food and my experience the experience is lovely here with wall accents of ripe and unripe persimmon colors and the slate grey bar with bamboo inspired tile the place is simple and sophisticated with and great ambient music and discrete lighting it s just so wonderful that i want someone to bring me my drink so that i can take it all in and not put it on pause i dream of going back without a child to get a buzz that only good sake can give and to try the ahi tuna seaweed salad and the braised pork belly buns with homemade hoisin sauce
0	the paratha was good we were the only ones there and the rice was overdone and starchy the chicken tikka was my least favorite chicken tikka i have ever had along with my partner s lamb dish there was very very little meat the spices were way off it was far more liquidy than i enjoy it wasn t the creamy warm comforting feeling i get when i eat maharani s chicken tikka this was some thin pieces of chicken in a greasy kind of tomatoy odd spiced mess i was going to give this place two stars but the hair i got in my chicken tikka and the hair my partner got in his lamb masala made me think it over
1	yum i definitely enjoyed my brunch here this afternoon i had the salmon lok and it was damn delicious anything with smoked salmon on it i have to try and i am so glad i did it came on toast with cream cheese and capers very yummy my girlfriends tried the coopers burger and the french onion soup and said it hit the spot decent service for the most part and the food came out quickly which i always like it was a nice enough day so we ate on the patio i didn t get much of a chance to check out the inside but i would like to see more of it next time i like that this place is a little bit off state street because its close enough that you can be part of the party but also not in the way of anyone you don t have to deal with drunk people stumbling around your food or too much noisiness they have cute flower decorations on the tables as well as candles
1	i was in town to visit my daughter and ate here several times while staying at the hampton inn just the fact that the hotel is attached to bassett street brunch club makes it the best hotel in the world but enough about them i can t say enough about this place i had the best salad i ve ever eaten loved the breakfast items and the m f happy hour great pours at great prices i always said i would go back but now i want to move into the place my daughter was pretty sick recently and couldn t get up off the couch they swooped in to the rescue and brought her soup even though they don t deliver and aren t really set up to do so the best people running a great business and going out of their way to help i m a huge fan of them and their french toast
0	went for lunch we both ordered pho portions price amount of ingredients were all good but the mainstay of pho is the broth there was no beef clove star anise flavor to be found i added all the jalapeños lime then garlic siracha and finally hoisin looking for flavor i told myself forgo the thought of the bowl in front of me as pho and just eat the noodles and beef i overlooked the dirty looking exterior when entering but started to look around a bit more closely when the pho disappointed the wall paint was peeling on both sides of the booth as well as in many other areas of the restaurant and the window area as we exited was disgustingly dirty that makes me question the condition of the kitchen we will never return based on food and certainly the atmosphere

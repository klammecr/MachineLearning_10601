0	large selection of drinks came here on a busy saturday night it s a bustling dark bar area environment with a lot of good specials there was something for everyone which was great the fries were good heavy and loaded with toppings largest complaint was service saw waitress only twice or three times in several hours took very long in between also and we couldn t properly order in addition she took a 40 tip for herself when giving me my change back i didn t want to wait another long length of time i was going to give them the tip anyways since i felt that they were maybe busy and understaffed and that was the reason for the slow service but i think the tip should ve been my choice it s a large space though and groups that do have the time
0	took over 8 mins for server to come greet us not even 75 of tables full my fiancé ordered the pancake platter and i ordered bacon wrapped sirloin 7 special and some crepes after a modest wait the crepes came to the table and the lady that delivered them different from server asked if we wanted another plate or if my fiancé was going to have anything i felt so embarrassed by that i m a pretty big guy and when she looked at me when she said that she looked disgusted apparently this happened because our server put this on a separate ticket and not with our meals so when our meals came out soon after we breathed a sigh of relief because i was worried that my fiancé s brunch was not coming so we dug in and started eating the eggs were not over medium they were over easy my sirloin steaks were ordered to be medium rare and came well done one was actually cooked so long it was dry i told our server and she replied ok i ll let them know and walked away to another table i then stopped a manager told him about it and he said they could take them back and cook new ones i said great and please bring my fiancé some butter for her pancakes well second try on the medium rare steaks came one was well done and the other was just over medium well also the butter i had asked for was no where to be seen so i just decided to choke them down not to mention while my drink glass was empty several people came by our table to deliver food or to check on us and not one asked if i d like a refill yeah this place is an ihop you re not going there to expect fine dining but if you want sunday brunch they better be able to deliver it the ihop in wausau wi would run circles around these people we went to the location in wausau many times with not one mistake nor any type of bad service there is only one good thing i can say about this dining experience thank you for the excellently buttered toast
0	below is the letter written to the cruise line when we came home from our experience to whom it may concern i would like to start by saying a group of friends and i were very excited about tonights tropical cruise we went so far as to follow the strongly suggested guidelines to dress accordingly for this themed outing we had accessories from head to toe that included flowers in our hair tropical clothing grass skirts and a myriad of leis as well because there was an offered prize for our efforts the night started off well the friendly captain informed us of the highlights which included the drink specials food details and 2 competitions taking place throughout the night the first alarming moment of the evening was when a member of our party noticed additional drink coupons were being distributed to some party patrons as they boarded the cruise please note that not one member of our 5 person group received one of these additional coupons worth noting because it was a surprise to us was the limited choice of liquor that was available with the buy one get one coupon that was issued with our ticket purchase i would suggest that it be noted in the brochure or mentioned at the time of ticket purchase that this perk is so limited during our introduction we were informed of the abundance of food that would be available to us because of the low attendance of this cruise myself my husband and my friend were the last of the 14 party goers to go through the buffet at this time the bacon wrapped pineapple was completely gone and the macadamia crusted grouper had only 2 remaining pieces for the 3 of us at no time were these or any other dishes ever refilled despite our report to the captain after returning to the bow once we finished our dinner the other couple in our party reported that the hula competition had taken place moments ago with only 4 of the fourteen patrons present those who where currently on the bow of the boat no one else on the boat was alerted that this opportunity to win another cruise was going to be taking place at this time this was extremely disappointing because it was a highlight that we were really looking forward to finally as the captain announced we were 10 minutes from shore my friend and i approached her to inquire about the second competition that of the best dressed luau attendee at this time she quite bluntly informed us while avoiding eye contact that that prize had alreday been given to the best tropical shirt on board please note that other than the five people in my party there was only one other person who even attempted to wear tropical attire this gentleman was quite mildly dressed in theme this guest seemed to be a returning customer as the captain knew him by name he was one of the people who received an extra drink coupon and it became clear at this time that he obviously had a connection with your cruise line needless to say myself and the members of my party were endlessly let down throughout what we thought was going to be a wonderful night we know very well that word of mouth speaks volumes and unfortunately we have nothing positive to say about this experience because of our extreme disappointment we felt it was important to make you aware of our negative experience i hope that by informing you of this it will help you to better serve your guests in the future sincerely
1	this is the first time we have been here for lunch on a sunday or anytime really it s a cosy small place with a friendly server and good beer selection i had the brisket sandwich and i substituted potato salad for the fries bother were very good for once there wasn t onions in it which i hate the brisket was smoky texas style and i added some of the regular sauce which was not that flavorful for me so i added some of the hot sauce and that was much better the worst thing here is the bun it soaks up the liquid from the meat so fast that it was saturated and gummy on the bottom before i had taken a couple of bites they either have to get a different bun or toast this one it before putting the brisket on it other than that it was very good it was a little pricey at 11 but it was a big quarter pound of meat so worth it give it a shot if in the area
1	i love graze i haven t had anything on the menu that i haven t enjoyed our table of 4 started off with a whole bunch of appetizers including the deviled eggs soft pretzel fries and cheese curds my favorites were the cheese curds and the soft pretzel mostly because of the three different mustards that came with the pretzel after finishing off our appetizers i didn t have room for a full entree though i m definitely getting the bibimbap next time so i split an order of the curry vegetables they came with lemon and garlic aioli but the veggies were very flavorful all on their own for dessert i ordered their special which was something along the lines of a dense raspberry brownie with vanilla ice cream it was pretty good but omg the chocolate chip cookies that my bf ordered were so much better these are not your average bake sale cookies and are definitely worth 6 for 3 they are crispy on the outside and warm and chewy on the inside and they are slightly salty which perfectly complements the sweet chocolate i couldn t tell if the salt was in the dough or sprinkled on top of the cookie because it was kind of dark in the restaurant but either way delicious the restaurant space itself is a treat huge floor to ceiling windows give you a straight on view of the capitol i ve been for brunch in the past too and the whole room is filled with warm sunlight during the day overall graze is worth the wait for a table and you probably will have to wait because this place is popular and doesn t take reservations i can t wait to come back
1	enjoyed two meals at this restaurant over the past weekend our dinner at the statehouse was truly spectacular the waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and wine list and gave us the opportunity to sample a wine before we ordered he was attentive throughout the meal without being overbearing the food was delicious i had the salmon and my companion had a steak both delicious and cooked just right in reading some of the previous reviews it seems that the service was not up to par they seemed to have figured it out we were delighted definitely an upscale experience a nice bonus is the gorgeous view from the restaurant lake mendota is beautiful lunch was also excellent our salads were fresh tasty and attractively presented i would highly recommend this restaurant for the food the service and the spectacular views
0	my friends wanted to try it out i warned them against it i caved because maybe it was just first day fluke after the waiter brought us items we didn t order and still charged us for them didn t bring us what we had ordered was extremely slow in serving us overcharged me and charged one of the other girls twice albeit an apology was given from the waiter nothing like oh have something small and cheap free on the house the next time you come in or any other method of good customer service was offered and the owner just kind of stood there the entire time doing nothing as this was going on other than saying she didn t know how to fix it my friends agreed with me sucks to be us
1	i came here on a weekday afternoon with my cousin and a friend for a light lunch the floor to ceiling windows give you a great view of the capitol building and the cocktail list is lovely we were able to try a few things we ve never thought of before the menu is limited but eclectic great for small taster plates with few substantial options our waiter was patient and attentive and the vibe of the place is overall pretty great if you re very hungry i d save this place for later but if you want to chill out and try their cheese plate make a trip i believe there s also a bakery here or at least affiliated
1	after having virtually no success in finding really inventive high quality chinese food lately in madison other than at the occasional kids home birthday party i was excited to see taigu pop up as a relatively new contender in the space for all you imperial garden and pf chang fans if you re really honest with yourself in the darkest of sleepless nights do either of these places really warrant the cost and hype thankfully taigu comes closest to giving a quality product for good value without trying too hard or promising too much the old staples sesame beef and general s chicken were meaty and not over breaded or over sauced both dishes could use a few veggies thrown in for good measure but the proteins were on the mark the fried dumplings were a really interesting blend of spices carrots and pork that felt more like a bao filling but totally worked the dipping sauce was meh but thankfully the dumplings held their own you can tell that the noodles were house made and house cut and wow what a difference that makes i wouldn t say the other house ingredients got me all that excited but when you order noodles and they are the star of the dish you ve basically got exactly what you wanted overall this is a good new discovery in the chinese food delivery landscape and i look forward to branching out into other parts of the menu in the very near future
1	what a great little hidden gem excellent food and service helbach s is new and located on the west side but don t think that means they aren t as trendy or high quality as our capitol coffee shops i seem to have hit a streak of awesome coffee shops in madison and this one was definitely one of them i had seen that they were new on yelp so i decided to try them out for lunch on the west side the first thing that struck me as awesome was the interior of the place along with the furniture helbach s is a family business and the interiors were done by their uncle while we were there they were also constructing a garden box out front to compliment the outdoor seating which was also pretty cozy i got the fetish breakfast sandwich and loved it the eggs were fresh and it came on a madison sourdough roll my friend got the chicken salad sandwich on a croissant and also really enjoyed it to drink i got the peach roibos iced again quite good the location is a bit off the beaten path it s back behind the west towne mall on the road that pier 1 is on but totally worth the visit i ll definitely be back and passing the word onto my friends the only complaint i have is that they re not closer to downtown where i live
0	peanut butter jelly time i think not not sure why the pb j is only appart of the lunch menu but if you want one for your child before 11 am dont count on it the two employees were unwilling to relay anything to management which we believe was skyping on the nearby couches that it is easier to make a pb j rather than a smoothie the employees only knew to say that it was against the policy to make a pb j before 11 am anyways i ordered an egg sandwich with tomato and turkey and it was just an ordinary sandwich in that i could have made the same thing at home but better because i would have had tobasco i asked for tobasco but was offered their homemade chili sauce which tasted like pureed sundried tomatoes with chili powder it wasn t bad but i enjoy the bite of tobasco with my eggs anywhoo so if that was management relaxing on the couches then shame on you for not standing up to defend your strict pb j policy and invest in a lil tobasco
0	met some friends here for late lunch over the weekend we were able to snag a table outdoors which was really nice since it looked dark and uninviting inside i got a fish sandwich with fries and husband got a byo burger with fries we each got a beer to go along with it as well it was good food i especially enjoyed the seasoning on the fries and tartar sauce for my sandwich however the bread on the sandwich was huge and the lettuce was wilty and slimy i ended up pulling all the lettuce off with just 2 beers and 2 sandwiches ordered fries were free sides i was surprised the bill was over 30 i d lower the food prices there a bit if i were in charge there foods good but not that great

1	i will never forget this single breakfast experience in madison it was awesome yes it is crowded and you have to sit with other groups at the large tables yes you have to pay cash yes it seems like you are eating breakfast in your grandmother s kitchen but seriously i like my grandmother s kitchen it is quite the experience and totally worth the perceived hassle the coffee was fresh and dark the chocolate croissant was to die for and the fruit covered french toast made from croissants was sinful if i ever find myself in madison again i will definitely go out of my way to return to this little gem of a breakfast nook
0	the search for decent chinese takeout in madison continues the food at this place we ordered delivery is nothing worth waiting 1 5 hours for greasy vegetable egg rolls which contain nothing but cabbage greasy lo mein they clearly do not understand how to work with tofu nor do they get how to deliver quality food in a timely fashion the one plus was the vegetables were still crunchy just save your time and money and don t bother not even a good dousing of sriraccha can make their ho hum food sparkle the reviews i ve seen from in house diners do not provide any contrast to our delivery experience
0	sorry but me julio fell way below the standard for even mediocre food first what s up with the popcorn okay so it is a balance between mexican and american well maybe but isn t it so american to understand that you always get a basket of chips and a bowl of salsa at an american mexican restaurant even my 11 year old grandson wondered about it without my commenting first enough about the popcorn my son ordered a burrito he said it was okay it was prepared opposite of what is typically expected the vegetables and salsa on the inside the meat served over the top of the burrito my daughter ordered chicken fajitas she had nothing good to say about the dish the chicken looked and tasted as if it was prepared in a bag cooked in a microwave it was not fizzling hot when it was served the tortillas which we assumed was flour were awful no one could not tell what they were made from the beans had an extremely odd texture probably the worse plate of fijitas we have ever experienced my mom ordered french onion soup really haha what is french onion soup doing on this menu doesn t matter but of course it received a mediocre rating as well she also had a taco salad she did not comment on it i ordered the salad with chicken goat cheese and figs dressing on the side of all the dishes served this was actually pretty good not excellent but good all in all we all agreed this was the last time we would be dining here we all agreed me julio s has been the worse mexican restaurant we have experienced
1	disclaimer came here for the night scene so i have no input on the food came here around 11 pm on a saturday night and i had a blast 4 wells mixed with good music soft lights and lots of people the drinks were just strong enough to be worth 4 and the service was very quick impressive for 11pm on saturday the dance floor had four or five tvs displaying the music videos of the song playing and the floor was pretty big there is a large couch encompassing the dance floor and there a quite a few tables i was very happy with this layout no cover and people were dressed in heels and ties seemed a little bit too good for a bar without cover and cheap drinks i plan on coming back on a different night am not sure if i got lucky or if madison s is the place i want to come back to every saturday night
1	so this is the kind of food that will kill you so there s that but that being said this is the best way i can think of to take in food with absolutely no nutritional value the ribs are sweet sticky tender meat bars the sides are sweet sticky flavor bombs of flavor the rolls are airy buttery balls of carbohydrates you should get extra napkins i think this place is best for carryout you can sit and eat there are a handful of tables but then there are also bullet holes in the windows since it s madison i m assuming someone put them there for show but definitely with a real gun so anyway i d rather eat at home also if you ve been doing the house of cards thing and want that bbq experience but you don t live in the south this is the closest you are going to get so check it out madison it s a little bit different but that doesn t mean it isn t fabulous
0	it s so sad that my third time coming here is not a good experience it was okay not fantastic when i came here for the first and second time but today when i was really craving for some hotpot i decided to have it here it is during the lunch time but the restaurant still has way too many empty seats the waitress speaks very limited english so i can t ask her for some explanation on some menu we were given two glasses of water one for me the other for my hubby just when i wanted to drink i was surprised to learn the glass is super dirty which made me think they didn t wash it i asked the waitress to change it and she didn t say sorry at all and it s been twenty minutes and more but i don t think our order will come anytime soon and oh the butterflies seem to be regulars too for this place while the overall place is not dirty i was wondering why this place doesn t mind having some butterflies flying around the customer s tables my hubby s thai tea came after 25 minutes we ordered our food i can t wait to write this review as i don t remember the last time i ever had a very bad experience with a restaurant won t be back anytime soon maybe next year or so and we had to pay 56 tips not included such a waste
0	this vientiene is horrible the owner is a cheap shrew and the food is subpar even compared to her sister s fare at the vientiene close to campus the owner of this park st location i hear they have now moved to sherman i believe was arrogant about the fact that their pad thai tastes like ketchup unlike the pad thai at legitimate restaurants could this be a cheap shortcut to the use of tomato paste and other seasonings the owner said that how we do it here we use ketchup she explained that the reason the other vientiene was different pad thai is that the other one is owned by her sister who does not use ketchup in the dish then the cheap woman accused us of merely not wanting to pay for the food when it was being sent back to the kitchen the sister at the vientiene by campus cannot smile to save her life and you will come out of there smelling like their kitchen but the food is better so go there and get it for takeout
1	oh my gosh this is the best place in madison i m from out of town and i got excited when my friend told me about it i m a breakfast gal and they serve breakfast all day here i was so happy i got the saturday special biscuits and fire roasted pepper gravy with two eggs over medium a side of bacon and potatoes amazing every bite was mouth watering see pictures my friends and i split a banana cream pie and it was also sooooo good every bite i wish i got my own slice haha i wanted to try everything on the menu vegan friendly kid friendly milk shakes breakfast great music outdoor seating countertop what more could you ask for with this diner service was also excellent enjoy
0	atmosphere very nice clean trendy however extremely loud they really need some sound absorption inside service this was the best part our waitress was very attentive knowledgeable and friendly food on the average side for the price point i had the butternut squash soup ok pork chop good pork but could have used some more flavor brussel sprouts very good and sweet potato excellent flavor but a lot of butter drinks friend had the old fashioned which i am not sure why they don t make a wisconsin style old fashion sad to say the glass was very small full of ice and not even filled to the top with the drink for 8 was very disappointed won t be going back but i wish them the best of luck in a very tough market
1	looking for beer this is the best spot in town with hundreds of choices you ll not be starved for decision my favorites are belgian beers like chimay blue duvel and fruit beers that taste like sparkling wine the local new glarus beer is also really tasty are you hungry no worries this place is the best in town for belgian frites double fried done right every single time as said by the boss also the soups and v burger is also a hit if you re just looking for bar food the sliders are really tasty as well i also like the truffle fries but if i had to pick the belgian frites are my favorite they also often do alot of beer tasting probably once a month very fun activity the space was recently expanded there s more bar space and a few more tables if you re there with just a friend sit at the bar they serve the full menu there as well if you wanna go there in a group it might be hard unless you re there before 6pm frites great beer and a great selection of french wine as well what more can you ask for
0	so we decided to cilantro a try apps and drinks were fine my dinner and my wife s dinner were luke warm at least our two other friends had hot food served to them took ten minutes to get our meals back the owner came over to apologize but the waiter never did when we got our bill which was good bill for 4 130 i expected to see something knocked off the bill due to having to send the food back last time i eat there and besides this review i will let others to go to our favorite mexican place la mestiza or casa del sol instead hasta la vista cilantro
0	this place is probably alright if you re there for a few drinks on a weeknight with some friends but don t come here for the food or service my gf took me here while we were visiting this past week because she used to come here often when she lived in madison i expected a decent meal i ordered the pork chop special and it was both overcooked and horribly lacking on meat i sent it back and ordered the carne asada which was horribly undercooked uhhh no deal discount on the meal either which any decent restaurant would at least offer if they wanted your repeat business the waitress admitted that the pork chop was the worst she d ever seen lame tell the cook then and have the manager work on that poorly managed place with sub par service staff definitely won t be coming back here
0	meh is the perfect descriptor for porta alba we went with a group of friends of whom 2 3 had been at the old location i have no complaints about the decor and really none about service neither stood out for good or bad reasons the food yeah meh the pizza was okay and yes i am aware this isn t supposed to be american pizza i ve tried pizza all over the globe and like each variation for its own reasons even my husband who will pretty much eat anything and at least say it was okay was pretty meh about it i had a special pasta dish just based on that i would give a 3 3 5 however because it s not a normal option and what i tried of my dining companions food was also meh it s not enough to raise the overall score upon leaving the restaurant my husband and i immediately named this a we won t pick this restaurant again but won t throw a huge fit if a group of friends want to go place thankfully we haven t had to go back
0	unacceptable the two stars is for the food we had spaghetti and meatballs my grandson had mac and cheese both delicious apparently the host had to host wait on tables and cook if you can t remember the order you should write it down ordered salads waited a very long time for our meals brought them out no salads told him to forget it half way through meal had to ask for garlic bread which was suppose to come with the meal it was a terrible experience especially with a 4 year old if your sign says open please have enough staff to accommodate your customers very poor management i ll go down the street to benvenutos next time
1	i stopped here while on a road trip to wisconsin for a bite and a brief respite encouraged by the highway signs this was the only place listed that was not a chain it s a couple miles off the road but easy to get to and easy to get back from i tried a wheat beer it was good if perhaps a tiny bit more bitter on the finish than i m used to bf had a red which he thought was good he ordered the uff da pretzel as he was not terribly hungry joke was on him it was huge it was bigger than a small pizza it was 1 1 2 pounds of pretzel goodness it came with two different mustard and a cheese sauce the mustards were good the pretzel was amazing but the cheese was the generic day glow yellow crap he also had a cup of beer cheese soup unusual in that it contained andouille he said it was okay but the sausage addition was a bit odd i had cheese curds as we d recently crossed the border into wi and they were calling to me a former native they were good but not amazing they make the white variety and serve them with a sweet mustard this was a good spot and a nice stop from the road
1	we had a large group dine at harvest on a weekday evening and were able to secure the private room upstairs which seats about a bit under 20 we got a set menu that included several options for each course i opted for the beet soup which was amazing it had a hint of cream in it which gave it a silky texture for my main i had the steak which was well cooked and came with some nice accompaniments except they didn t have horseradish the chocolate desert was mousse like and a nice way to close out the evening the wine and beer list is pretty comprehensive and includes variety in both type and price if you re in the madison area this is worth a stop after or before dinner there a few bars close by but you can also stroll around the capital building and work off your meal this place is far enough away from state street that it doesn t get to wild which makes it nice for a business meal or date night
1	this place is perfect if i lived anywhere nearby i d come all the time great alcohol selection great good live music and all really reasonably priced beer wise not only is their selection really extensive but you have the option to get most of the draft beers in smaller sizes to get a wider sample one of my favorite optios at any bar the burger was huge and delicious cooked perfectly the servers take on a huge number of tables but are super efficient checking in with you exactly when you need them and not when you don t music wise don t worry that you re going to miss the 10pm start the band had just started to play at 10 and was at least an hour late that said we barely got a table at 10 so you might need to come early to grab at seat at this amazing bar
0	i ve heard people rave about brazilian steakhouses and i finally went with high hopes but left really quite disappointed my overall impression is that samba is a steak and other assorted meats buffet but a pain in the ass because you have to wait for someone to come by and cut off an appetizer sized portion of meat and you pay through the nose for it the taste of some of the food is ok you start with a buffet of salads breads stews i got some chicken tort not good wisconsin cheeses good but you can get them anywhere in the area for cheap and cheese filled rolls excellent but you should probably not fill up too much since the real experience is in the meats and pineapple that the servers bring to your table at samba you flip a big red green plastic thing to indicate when you want food if you have it green side up then servers will come by your table and cut off a modestly sized piece of meat or pineapple and so on until you flip your thing back over to red so you can eat the sausage was quite good the leg of lamb was cooked well but the meat was a bit too gamey for my liking the top sirloin was disappointing as hell there were a couple decent bites but the slices i got were mostly overcooked and some pieces were loaded with inedible gristle the pineapple has cinnamon and sugar and just tastes like warm pineapple with cinnamon and sugar assuming you get a piece with cinn and sugar on it which only outside pieces have i was greatly disappointed by a few of the meats like marinated flank steak and honey chicken with the exception of the sausage which was quite good but not special i was overall pretty disappointed i am not brazilian and am not an expert but i have had brazilian food before if you didn t tell me that samba was brazilian i would never have guessed it was supposed to be critically caipirinhas are like the drink of brazil and the one i had at samba was the worst one i ever had that s disappointing since they re one of my favorite cocktails the service was sloowwwwwwwwwwwwwwww we were there at a 5pm on thursday they open at 5pm and the place wasn t getting full until we just about finished our meal but it still took forever for our drinks to get refilled get our bill etc i don t blame our waitress so much it seemed like she just had a lot of tables to take care of i think if you re charging 37 or whatever a plate you can afford to hire adequate staff overall as many other yelp reviewers have already said the quality of food does not justify the price my fiance and i had two dinners two caipirinhas and a fountain drink which cost us over 100 and it was in no way worth 100 let alone even half that if i were to ignore the price i d give samba 2 stars but i can t rate them at any more than 1 given the high price for pedestrian food
1	first time in a which witch and i was presently surprised efficient and interesting set up with reasonable prices this chain had the banh mi as a special and it was way better than i expected it to be i usually get mine from legitimate vietnamese stores and i was expecting this one to be a huge let down especially since it s a white ish chain racist maybe sorry not sure maybe if i have to ask it is yes the sandwich is a little different than the original and it s missing the pâté but seriously a solid variation definitely would come again
1	the walnut burger with beet ketchup is by far the best thing on the lunch and dinner menu jacs always has great beers on tap and plenty of variety in menu offerings it is well known that folks in the area go for half price happy hour although tonight we went at 6 15pm typical happy hour time and we did not receive happy hour prices this is the main reason we go prior to 7pm and will continue to visit regardless of happy hour deals but this is a nice incentive needless to say we will be back but we will also select a different spot for post work drinks since their deals have become unclear
